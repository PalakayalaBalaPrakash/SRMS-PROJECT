# SRMS-PROJECT
This project demonstrates a complete student management system implemented with role-based access control. It allows different user roles (Admin, Staff, Guest) to perform specific operations on student records stored in text files.
User Roles
The system supports three distinct user roles with different permissions:

Admin: Full access to all operations
Staff: Can add, view, search, and update students
Guest: Can only view and search students
